A configuration file has been created at tvmover.json

Be sure to edit this file and configure the input and output directories, otherwise the program
will not run.

Use the log file to debug issues with your configuration. (path is specified in the config)

Note when writing your config: a '\' means that a special character follows. To get a single '\'
you must write two: '\\'. For this reason, it's easier to write paths on Windows using forward
slashes instead of backslashes: C:/Users/myuser/Documents rather than C:\\Users\\myuser\\Documents

You can delete this file.

Thanks for using TVMover.
